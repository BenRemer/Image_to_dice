This program takes a picture and breaks it into blocks of your choosing (default to 7x7). Averages each block to one greayscale color and replaces that with a side of a dice, 6 for darkest 1 for lightest. Then saves that image and the array of dice so it can be built and seen.

Usage: python Dice.py --help for all commands and how to use them
